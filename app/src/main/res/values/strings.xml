    <string name="gre_general_score_scales_details"> - The Verbal Reasoning score is reported on a scale of 130 to 170, in 1 point increments.\n\n - The Quantitative Reasoning score is reported on a scale of 130 to 170, in 1 point increments.\n\n - The Analytical Writing Assessment is reported on a scale of 0 to 6, in half (0.5) point increments.\n\n - Any section with all unattempted questions is reported as No Score (NS).</string>

    <string name="gre_general_score_computer_title">Computer-delivered Test</string>
    <string name="gre_general_score_computer_details"> - All operational sections (apart from the Experimental Section) contribute towards the total score.\n\n - For V-Measure and Q-Measure, a raw score is computed. The raw score is the number of questions answered correctly. Within each section, all questions contribute equally to the total score. The raw score is then converted to a scaled score through a process called equating, which accounts for the minor variations in the toughness levels across sections as well as test dates.\n\n - For AWA-Measure, each essay receives a score from one human moderator and a score from one computer program called e-rater. If the both these scores closely agree, the ultimate score is their average. If not, then another score is obtained from a human moderator and the ultimate score for the essay is the average of two human scores. The overall score for AWA-Measure is the average score obtained for the two essays, rounded to nearest half-point interval on the 0 to 6 scale.\n\n - The scores are reported for V-Measure, Q-Measure and AWA-Measure separately. For example, V: 160, Q: 163, AWA: 4.5</string>
