    <string name="gre_general_score_computer_title">Computer-delivered Test</string>
    <string name="gre_general_score_computer_details"> - All operational sections (apart from the Experimental Section) contribute towards the total score.\n\n - For V-Measure and Q-Measure, a raw score is computed. The raw score is the number of questions answered correctly. Within each section, all questions contribute equally to the total score. The raw score is then converted to a scaled score through a process called equating, which accounts for the minor variations in the toughness levels across sections as well as test dates.\n\n - For AWA-Measure, each essay receives a score from one human moderator and a score from one computer program called e-rater. If the both these scores closely agree, the ultimate score is their average. If not, then another score is obtained from a human moderator and the ultimate score for the essay is the average of two human scores. The overall score for AWA-Measure is the average score obtained for the two essays, rounded to nearest half-point interval on the 0 to 6 scale.\n\n - The scores are reported for V-Measure, Q-Measure and AWA-Measure separately. For example, V: 160, Q: 163, AWA: 4.5</string>

    <string name="button_done">MARK AS DONE</string>
    <string name="button_pending">MARK AS PENDING</string>

    <!--strings for Step1 Activity-->
    <string name="step1_intro">To begin with, you must know what you want to do. You must have a clear idea about what you have done till now, in terms of your education, work experience, likes and dislikes. You cannot simply go ahead and pursue a random academic program by shelling out a sum of money.</string>

    <string name="step1_heading1">Do what you love</string>
    <string name="step1_body1">Well, this might be one of the most hackneyed thought that you have heard. As familiar as it gets, this little phrase speaks out the best advice. And this is probably the ideal time to decide what you love.\n\nYou cannot simply pursue further education in the area you have been working relentlessly just because you landed up there. If you pursue further education without careful deliberation over what you actually want to do, then you are very likely to end up into a trouble and eventually hating your life.\n\nIrrespective of whether you like your own area of study, it is essentially important to think about what you want to do. This might be in terms of what you love doing, or what you like studying about, or what kind of job you like - something on similar lines.</string>

    <string name="step1_heading2">Decide what you want to do</string>
    <string name="step1_body2">You might end up having multiple interests, or even mixed interests. That is absolutely okay. Channelise your thoughts deeply by looking at each of these interests to arrive at one. If not, try to end up with up to two interests, which are mostly similar. The crux here is that you need to know and be completely clear about what you want to do, before proceeding with anything else. A wrong decision at this stage can be extremely painful.</string>

    <string name="step1_heading3">Do not fear</string>
    <string name="step1_body3">You might feel that something you want to is very divergent from what you have doing till now. It might be a completely disparate domain of study. Do not get scared or even hesitate at this point. There is a lot more to do ahead. So, it is okay to want to do something that does not align with your current area of study or work.</string>

    <!--strings for Step2 Activity-->
    <string name="step2_intro">Once you have decided what you want to do, it is a perfect time to research. This is the most crucial step in the entire process. A thorough research into the area in which you want to go ahead gives you the ultimate call for pursuing it, and in some cases, warns you to be cautious. Now, there are a lot of things that you need to research. Let us take them one by one.</string>

    <string name="step2_heading1">Area of Study</string>
    <string name="step2_body1">It may be the case that you have an overview of the area of study you want to get in. However, it is vital to know the depth of it. You must know what the area of study is all about and what all components does it cover. Any misunderstandings or even doubts that you might have about the area of study must be cleared at this point. You must know what you are going to be dealing with.</string>

    <string name="step2_heading2">Relevant Programs</string>
    <string name="step2_body2">Once you know what exactly you are going to study, it is time to research about the universities and their programs in the corresponding area of study. You have to know what these programs provide as a part of their curriculum, what kind of learning is expected from these programs. There may be several programs from the same university or even multiple universities and each of them might have something distinct.</string>

    <string name="step2_heading3">Career Outcomes</string>
    <string name="step2_body3">This part is very fragile. You must carefully consider and look at the career outcomes of each of the programs that you have researched. You need to know what kind of careers open up for students of the particular area of study. Additionally, it is better to have an idea about that kind of work and salary does each of these job roles associates with.</string>

    <string name="step2_heading4">Future Prospects?</string>
    <string name="step2_body4">It should be noted that this part is not the same as researching about career outcomes. Researching about future prospects involves learning about what the long term picture looks like. Where can you land up in the long term if you pick this up? Even for people who might not be into industry based programs, this is a good task to do.</string>

    <string name="step2_heading5">Do not be afraid to go back</string>
    <string name="step2_body5">By this time, you should have a good knowledge about what the area of study that you are looking for is about, what you are going to study, what kind of jobs will open up and what the related professional future might look like. If you are happily willing to pursue the area of study based on your thorough research, then you are all set. On the other side, if you have researched and got your questions answered, and still feel unsure, then do not be afraid to go back and introspect. Maybe, mixed interests brought you thinking you like this area of study. Pick the right area of study and repeat.</string>

    <string name="step2_heading6">Research thoroughly</string>
    <string name="step2_body6">A thorough research is going to help you decide properly. You need to be absolutely serious as well as curious. You have got the internet, search through it. Visit trusted websites. Look for deeper content. Connect with seniors and professionals who are familiar with the area of study to gather advice. Talk on phone, chat using messengers, get connected on platforms like LinkedIn. Do all of it, because this is what will give you the information you need.</string>

    <!--strings for Step3 Activity-->
    <string name="step3_intro">Now that most of the aspects are getting more concrete, with a solid decision on which area of study to go ahead with, you need to look for universities and programs. This is the time when you collect the names of programs and universities you would want to enroll in.</string>

    <string name="step3_heading1">Countries and Regions</string>
    <string name="step3_body1">Now is the time to decide and plan which country you want to go to. Is there anything precise? Does you area of study have good universities and industry in certain regions? These are some of the questions that need to be answered now. You might also want to consider the cost of living there.</string>

    <string name="step3_heading2">Universities</string>
    <string name="step3_body2">You need to now dig deeper and gather information about universities. Take into account factors like location, culture, industry relations and reputation of each of the universities during this process. It is important to note that a university might be well known in general, but may not be good for your area of study or vice versa.</string>

    <string name="step3_heading3">Programs</string>
    <string name="step3_body3">Well, what really matters is the program that you are looking for. Whether it is a masters or a doctorate or a specialisation? What are the ingredients of the program and what are you looking for? Various universities might have distinct curriculum under similar programs. There might be even multiple programs under the same university relating to your area of study. Choose carefully, considering factors like learning outcomes and career aspects. You might want to look at the fee structure and other expenses as well, along with scholarships.</string>

    <string name="step3_heading4">Organise the list</string>
    <string name="step3_body4">At the end of this step, you should have a concise list of universities and their respective programs in which you are interested to apply. Try to get your list reduced to somewhere around 6 to 9 entries. Again, take help from all possible sources. It can be seniors, professionals or anyone who has been in your shoes. Furthermore, the web is always there by your side.</string>

    <!--strings for Step4 Activity-->
    <string name="step4_intro">After boiling down it all to a list of universities and programs, it is time for you to appear for tests. Yes, exam time! This process, again, has to be done properly.</string>

    <string name="step4_heading1">Know your tests</string>
    <string name="step4_body1">In the planning stage where you ended up with a list of universities and programs, you researched and browsed their details. One of them was the requirements for application to each program. If you have not done that yet, this is the time to visit the websites of your shortlisted programs and make a note of their corresponding application requirements. For this step, you must know the exams or tests required by each program. Further, you must know what each test is all about. Grab some details in terms of the syllabus, exam pattern, mode of exam and preparation time required.</string>

    <string name="step4_heading2">Register</string>
    <string name="step4_body2">Once you have got hold of every information about the tests that you must take, it is always recommended that you register yourself for these tests. You must draft a proper timeline with respect to what you are currently doing and your schedule in order to estimate the time you will need to prepare for these tests. Once you have the test dates with you, you have some pressure to seriously study and prepare in time. This is the prominent reason why you are advised to register for the tests before beginning with the preparation. However, do remember to keep a enough time gap for preparation while selecting your test dates.</string>

    <string name="step4_heading3">Prepare</string>
    <string name="step4_body3">If you have been following the above mentioned steps, that means that you have your test dates with you. Do not waste your time now. Start preparing for your tests. Practice a lot. Take coaching, only if you feel so. Each test requires a distinct kind of preparation, ranging from the syllabus to the time needed for preparation.</string>

    <string name="step4_heading4">Score well</string>
    <string name="step4_body4">As the test date approaches, you might get anxious. It is absolutely okay. Do not get stressed too much. Give your best while you appear for the tests and try to score well. In case you feel that you have not scored in line with your expectations, most tests provide you with the option to retake the test after a certain number of days.</string>

    <!--strings for Step5 Activity-->
    <string name="step5_intro">Cumulative Grade Point Average, commonly known as CGPA is one of the quantitative factors that indicates your academic performance and is a part of the application demanded by most programs.</string>

    <string name="step5_heading1">Maintain it high</string>
    <string name="step5_body1">If you are yet to graduate or complete your education and have even a slight chance of improving your CGPA, do not lose it. It is extremely important to maintain a really good CGPA to make your application stand out. CGPA is one of the ways to indicate your academic capability. It often is a criteria to select a few top applications out of the many received, though there is no formal validation for this. In conclusion, it is always good to have a high CGPA. Try your best, if you have a chance.</string>

    <string name="step5_heading2">Why does it matter?</string>
    <string name="step5_body2">CGPA speaks for your academic competency. It is an indication of your ability to cope up with academics, among several other things that happen around you. CGPA shows whether you are hardworking and diligent in terms of your learning path. So, even if you plan to pursue further education in a completely new area of study, it is essentially crucial to maintain a good CGPA.</string>

    <!--strings for Step6 Activity-->
    <string name="step6_intro">Letters of Recommendation, or LORs in short, are one of the integral part of your application. It is extremely important to pay considerable attention towards LORs.</string>

    <string name="step6_heading1">Why do LORs matter?</string>
    <string name="step6_body1">The primary purpose of any Letter of Recommendation is to recommend you as a student at the corresponding program based on your positive aspects. LORs are given by your professors, your colleagues at workplace, your manager or anyone you may have worked with. Your interaction with the person who recommends you (also known as the recommender) is essentially important. Any recommendation that you get is based on your professional interaction with him or her. It may be in terms of a class or a course, a project, a thesis, an internship, or even work. LORs indicate your professional behaviour, with mostly all positive points. In general, LORs may mention your good interactive behaviour, your fast learning ability, your ethics, your co-curricular, etc. Thus, LORs give an overall picture about you as a person.</string>

    <string name="step6_heading2">Strong LORs</string>
    <string name="step6_body2">There is often an issue of strong vs weak LOR. Well, there is no clear distinction as to whether a Letter of Recommendation can be considered strong or weak. It is all relative. However, a generally accepted trend may give you some idea. LOR from a recommender with whom you may have worked on a project for 6 months or even a year counts as a strong LOR in comparison to the one from a recommender with whom you just have taken up some course or workshop. LOR from a recommender holding a senior level designation may count as a strong LOR in comparison to the one from a recommender who has a lesser experience and holds a junior level position. Therefore, a combination of the following factors contribute towards the strength of your LOR:\n\n - Level of interaction between you and the recommender\n\n - Designation of the recommender\n\n - What the recommender mentions in the LOR</string>

    <string name="step6_heading3">Number of LORs</string>
    <string name="step6_body3">The number of LORs you need for your application varies with respect to the program and university you are applying to. Some programs mandate exactly 3 LORs, some programs mandate a minimum of 3 LORs, while others have an upper limit on the number of LORs, while further others do not hold any restriction on the number of LORs. Even more, certain programs might require you to have some precise number of LORs from a recommender in your academic background out of the total LORs that you include as a part of your application. So, in a nutshell, the constraints on LORs vary a lot. You should make a note of these for your shortlisted programs and universities.</string>

    <string name="step6_heading4">The process</string>
    <string name="step6_body4">From the time you decide that you want to pursue higher education, you need to pull your socks up. The entire process of building your application includes ensuring your LORs. As you take up courses, or do projects, or work as intern or full time employee, you need to be at your best. You need to sort your recommenders. Try to get as many as you can. Also, the process of submitting LORs during the application process is slightly unusual. Most universities require you to list the details of your recommenders while applying. A form is then sent to your recommenders by mail. Your recommenders are then required to answer the form and upload LOR remotely. Hence, it is important for you to remain in touch with your recommenders and notify them of the process and the deadlines.</string>

    <!--strings for Step7 Activity-->
    <string name="step7_intro">A good set of projects is one of the many factors considered as a part of your application. It takes time to build this part of your application, and thus, you must be patient.</string>

    <string name="step7_heading1">Why do projects matter?</string>
    <string name="step7_body1">Projects related to your intended area of study put additional weight on your application. You do projects in a particular area of study because you like it, and you want to explore and do things. Projects in a way express your familiarity and expertise in the corresponding area of study. They convey that you have a certain degree of practical knowledge.</string>

    <string name="step7_heading2">Number of projects</string>
    <string name="step7_body2">There is no limit on the number of projects that you can do. It is always good to have as many projects as possible. However, it is important to note that quality exceeds quantity. Your projects should really have that core content and some real work behind it. Having many light projects might not help you. Instead, you should have a decent number of projects that actually have solid content and speak for themselves. Hence, ensure that each project is worth the endeavour and time that you put in.</string>

    <string name="step7_heading3">Showcase</string>
    <string name="step7_body3">It is equally important to display your projects in a proper manner. Every area of study has its own way of showcasing work. For example, coding and development projects are usually uploaded on GitHub whereas design projects are usually showcased in the form of portfolios and websites. So, build your professional account accordingly. Additionally, it is a good habit to update your project accomplishments on professional social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Behance, etc.</string>
